# Honkai-Star-Rail-Bot
PLEASE READ: With the recent update of HSR to Version 3.7, a new in-game feature allows for players to select the amount of runs to do in one go, eliminating the need for this automation. It will be left up incase anyone wants to use it to develop other projects. 

A rudimentary Java based bot programmed in VSCode utilizing Tesseract OCR and various Java libraries to automate tasks in the video game Honkai: Star Rail (HSR)
